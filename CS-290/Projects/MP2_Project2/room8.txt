Padded Cell-The room in a hospital for mentally ill people, with soft material on the walls so that they cannot hurt themselves. The rooms seems a little off, as noone is in this room. But, you realise that this room was holding someone dangerous, and you sucessfully opening the room has released this patient. Hope, you didnot release a monster that is going to come back and haunt you later.This room is for Jerome Valeska, aka Joker. You came in through a door south of the room and there is another door east of the room. A writing on the wall is written in blood, "See, I'm Not A Monster, I'm just Ahead of the Curve"-0-The room in a hospital for mentally ill people, with soft material on the walls so that they cannot hurt themselves.
