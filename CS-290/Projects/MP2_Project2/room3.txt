Basement-The first thing that you notice that there is a pit of mud, maybe someone was trying to hide something there. As you were walking in you saw that lays a toolbox, in which there is a screwdriver. Also, another paper by Selena is lying to the west of the pit and next to it is a blue medallion. There is a stairwell leading upwards located towards the east of the room as well as a lift located towards the south of the room.-5-key1-map4-mud-screwdriver-medallion_2-There is a key inside the mudpit.
