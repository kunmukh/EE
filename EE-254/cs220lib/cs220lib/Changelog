May 6, 2010 Version 1.23
Updated README.txt file.  Added new comments to cs220lib.S.

May 5, 2010 Version 1.22
Modified all of the routines in the library so that they can
be used without having to worry about 16 byte alignment on the
Mac.  The routines make sure that the stack pointer is aligned 
before calling any OS routines.  The programmer will need to make
sure that the stack is aligned properly when making any OS calls
directly on the Mac.

April 17, 2010 Version 1.21
Fixed bug in skeleton.s and example.s to keep stack 16-byte
aligned on the Mac.

April 15, 2010 Version 1.20
Modified (print|read)_(single|double)ptr routines so that they
save the FPU registers to the same area of memory as the
non-ptr routines.

April 13, 2010 Version 1.19
Fixed typo in user's manual.
Added print_singleptr and print_doubleptr routines in which EAX
holds address of number.  FPU stack is not changed.
Added read_singleptr and read_doubleptr routines in which numbers
are stored at address in EAX register.

April 7, 2010 Version 1.18
Made several modifications so that the library will compile on the
Mac.  The Mac uses an older version of the assembler and so some
of the newest syntax is not recognized.  Changed all ".string"
directives to ".asciz".  Change char constants $'\n to $10. Add
comma at the end of .section lines.

Also made several adjustments to the stack pointer so that it
is always 16-byte aligned on all function calls.  The Mac requires
this.

This is 32-bit assembly.  To compiler under a 64 bit OS pass the
"-m32" option to g++ and the linker.

December 17, 2009 Version 1.17
Modified cs220lib.h so that _asm_main can be used as entry point
in both Windows and Linux

October 30, 2009 Version 1.16
Changed "#include <iostream>" to "#include <cstdio>" in main.cpp.

May 18, 2007 Version 1.15
Added README.txt and documentation.

May 17, 2007 Version 1.14
Made changes to portably handle function prefixes on different
platforms.  Changes require that the main assembly function should
be named asm_main under Linux (and on other platforms that do
not use a function prefix) and _asm_main under Windows.

May 5, 2007 Version 1.13
Changed extension of cs220lib.s "s" to "S".
The "S" extension implies that the file should be automatically
preprocessed with the C preprocessor (cpp) before assembly.
With the "s" extension, the "-x assembler-with-cpp" option to
g++ had to be used when assembling.  With the "S" extension this
option is no longer necessary.  The Makefile was changed
accordingly.
Updated cslib_version string in cs220lib.S to "CS220LIB V01.13".
Some cosmetic improvements were made to the main.cpp file.

April 5, 2007 Version 1.12
Modified read_line to check that line feed is actually at the
end of the line before overwriting with a null character.  Also
fixed a bug in which the routine expected the input buffer to
be 257 bytes instead of 256 bytes as documented.

May 31, 2006 Version 1.11
Added call to flush in print_single/print_double routines.

May 3, 2006 Version 1.10
Rewrote single/double routines to save FPU stack to statically
allocated memory.

May 2, 2006 Version 1.09
Rewrote a portion of read_double/read_single to more intelligently
use the stack.

May 2, 2006 Version 1.08
Fixed bug in str_length.  Fixed bug in read_double/read_single
introduced in Version 1.07

April 25, 2006 Version 1.07
Fixed bugs in floating point print and read routines.
The EAX, ECX, and EDX registers were not preserved.
They are altered by printf/scanf and so need to be saved and
restored.

April 22, 2006 Version 1.06
Fixed print_single, print_double, read_single, read_double routines.
The FPU stack should have been empty before calls to printf and scanf
and they were not.  This caused problems when the stack was full.

April 12, 2006 Version 1.05
Added str_length routine.

April 05, 2006 Version 1.04
Changed floating point output format specifier from %e to %g.

March 24, 2006 Version 1.03
Fixed floating point routines print_single, print_double, read_single,
and read_double.

March 23, 2006 Version 1.02
Added floating point routines print_single, print_double, read_single,
and read_double.

March 17, 2006 Version 1.01
Remove -g (debugging) only from Makefile so that library is built
without debugging information included.

March 15, 2006 Version 1.00
Initial Release
